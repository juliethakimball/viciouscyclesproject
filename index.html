         Vicious Cycles Inc is a (your town)-based cycle workshop founded by a few like-minded individuals in late 2010. Our mechanics build the bikes and man the workshop. Our customer service staff attends to the day-to-day operations. We hope to create and foster a strong passion for the local biking scene because every one of us is a biking enthusiast. <br>
         We believe that every machine should be an extension of its owner. We believe in the significance of individualism. We believe in the stories between your cycle and you. We believe in having fun. No matter the circumstances, we bike hard and we bike often.
      </p>

      <p>
         You get on your bike, you ride, you fall, you might get pulled over, you overcome it all and you ride again. It’s a Vicious Cycle! So make it worth the while, don't just be part of the numbers. Ride your cycle, chase your dreams, live your life.
      </p>

      <h3>Our services</h3>

Our staff will assist you every step of the way, from product selection and ordering to truly custom builds. We’ve been doing this whole custom thing for quite a while, and we've seen some ups and downs, we're loving every moment of it. A proper custom build takes time, and we’ll work closely with you to get it right. From stylish cycles to trusty monster rides, we’ve done them all. Talk with a member of our mechanic's team to discuss your plan, and we'll see your dream realized. <br>
